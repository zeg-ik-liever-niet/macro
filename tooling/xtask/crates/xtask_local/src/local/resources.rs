//! The single catalog of local AWS resources (SQS queues, S3 buckets, DynamoDB
//! tables).
//!
//! Two places need these names: [`localstack`](super::localstack) *creates* the
//! resources, and [`local_env`](super::local_env) emits the env vars services
//! use to *find* them. Before this catalog the lists lived in both files and
//! could silently drift — a queue created but not exported (or vice-versa) is a
//! service that can't reach a queue that exists. Here they share one list, so
//! adding a resource in one place is impossible: creation and env both follow
//! from a single entry.
//!
//! Rule of thumb: a name is a `const` only when something *outside* the catalog
//! iteration also references it (the upload-finalizer wiring, the seed env);
//! everything else is an inline literal in its entry.
