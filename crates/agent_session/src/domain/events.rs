//! Agent session lifecycle facts, published to
//! [`MacroAgentSessionLifecycleTopic`] and keyed by session id.
//!
//! These are facts about a session after the fact - opened, a turn started or
//! ended, nothing left to do, asking its owner something, gone - for anyone
//! downstream to react to: webhooks, notifications, observability. Commands
//! that *drive* a session travel on `macro.agent_sessions` instead.
//!
//! Consumers that only decode these events depend on this crate with
//! `default-features = false`: the domain compiles without the inbound and
//! outbound adapters' axum, sqlx, and client dependencies.
