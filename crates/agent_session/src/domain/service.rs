//! Persistence and active lifecycle management for agent sessions.
//!
//! Inbound adapters depend on [`AgentSessionService`] rather than repository
//! ports. Protocol decisions live in [`super::session`]'s pure machine, and
//! each connection's effects are executed by its actor shell.
//!
//! A session's log is the source of truth. The writer projects its current
//! turn state onto the session row for lists; conversation readers fold the
//! frames themselves.
//!
//! A live session's log is written by its actor, which is handed a
//! [`LiveSessionLogWriter`] rather than the bare repository. Anyone writing a
//! run of frames in order has somewhere to keep state, so that writer holds an
//! `agent_fold` machine and pushes each frame into it - which is what keeps a
//! reconnecting session's [`TurnId`](agent_fold::domain::model::TurnId)s
//! counting from where the session actually is, rather than from zero. The
//! streamed chunks that make up most of a log cost one push and no I/O. That
//! is a session's actor, and equally `seed_jsonl` replaying a recording.
//!
//! [`LiveSessionLogWriter`] is also where a live session's frames are
//! streamed from, for the same reason: it is the one place every frame of a
//! connected session passes through, so anything a viewer should see as it
//! happens has to be published from there. The push cannot fail the durable
//! append - see [`AgentSessionRealtime`].
