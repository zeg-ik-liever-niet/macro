//! Unconfirmed client actions folded on a fork of the confirmed history.
//!
//! A client that issues an action knows exactly which frame the harness will
//! log for it, because the harness builds that frame with
//! [`AgentAction::to_runtime`] and this module builds its copy the same way.
//! So the fold can show the action's effect before the log confirms it:
//! the confirmed machine stays authoritative, and the unconfirmed frames form
//! a *suffix* replayed on a clone of it. Three things can then happen to a
//! suffix entry:
//!
//! - **Promote.** A confirmed row matches it - same request id, or for a
//!   frame that carries none the same method or content - and the entry is
//!   dropped. The committed machine now derives what the fork already
//!   showed, minus the pending mark.
//! - **Rebase.** A confirmed row matches nothing while the suffix is
//!   non-empty. It belongs *before* the suffix, so the fork is rebuilt:
//!   clone the committed machine, replay the suffix.
//! - **Retract.** The caller learns the server will never log it (the POST
//!   failed, the control was rejected) and the suffix loses it. Rebase.
//!
//! Only frames this client causes are ever synthesized. What the runtime
//! answers is never predicted: a speculated stop renders as stopping and a
//! speculated prompt as starting, and the turn closes when the log says so.
//!
//! Think of a git rebase: the confirmed log is upstream, the suffix is the
//! local commits replayed on top, and each one disappears the moment upstream
//! contains it.
