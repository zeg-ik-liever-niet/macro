//! The ACP adapter, on the SDK's own connection machinery.
//!
//! [`serve`] registers one typed handler per method on
//! [`agent_client_protocol::Builder`] and hands the transport to the SDK.
//! Everything transport-shaped that used to live here is the SDK's job now,
//! and deliberately so — each of these was once hand-built in this file, as an
//! invariant maintained by design notes:
//!
//! - **One outgoing queue.** Responses and `session/update` notifications
//!   leave through the same queue, so a `session/prompt` response can never
//!   overtake the updates of its own turn. The SDK's outgoing actor is that
//!   queue; [`AcpNotifier`] pushes into it via the connection handle rather
//!   than owning a second one.
//! - **EOF drains the queue.** Responses already accepted when the client
//!   hangs up are written out before the connection future resolves, so a
//!   client that batches requests and closes its end still gets every answer.
//! - **Unknown methods answer `method_not_found`**, with the method name in
//!   the error data.
//!
//! What remains here is what is genuinely this agent's: which methods exist,
//! what each one does to the session service, and which MCP servers can
//! honestly be forwarded to a cloud sandbox.
//!
//! Prompts and cancels run on connection-spawned tasks so a long-running turn
//! never blocks the event loop — that is what lets `session/cancel` land while
//! a turn is streaming.

/// The session's config options: model and any effort values its variant supports.

/// session is on — ACP carries it as `configOptions` on the `session/new`,
/// `session/load` and `session/set_config_option` responses, and a client reads
/// the same field whichever response it arrived on.
///
/// One entry per model, using Cursor's own default variant, rather than one per
/// variant: `claude-opus-4-8` alone offers forty, and a picker listing hundreds
/// of near-identical rows is worse than one listing the models. Exposing the
/// reasoning variant is projected as a separate ACP thought-level control;
/// unrelated variant parameters remain on Cursor's selected default.
///
/// The entries go out grouped by family ([`ModelFamily`]) — ACP's select
/// options may be headed groups — so a client can show `Claude Opus` once with
/// its versions under it rather than forty rows sorted by nothing. The family
/// is inferred from the display name, because Cursor's listing carries nothing
/// else to group on. A listing where no family has two members goes out flat:
/// a header per single model is noise, not structure.
///
/// A failure to reach `GET /v1/models` costs the picker, not the session: the
/// options come back empty and the client simply has nothing to offer, which is
/// the state it was in before any of this existed.
