//! The Cursor cloud API client.
//!
//! A plain reqwest wrapper over `api.cursor.com`'s Cloud Agents API — create
//! an agent, follow up with runs, cancel, and stream a run's SSE events. It
//! knows nothing about ACP; it implements the domain's
//! [`CursorAgents`]/[`RunStream`] ports, retaining native SSE records for
//! capture before the domain decodes them.
//!
//! Authentication is HTTP Basic with the API key as username and an empty
//! password, per Cursor's docs. The key is validated for shape at
//! construction so a placeholder pasted into a config fails at startup with
//! a message, not at first prompt with a bare 401.
