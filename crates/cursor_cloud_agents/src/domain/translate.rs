//! The pure Cursor→ACP translation.
//!
//! [`TranslateMachine`] takes one [`CursorEvent`] at a time and reports the
//! ACP [`SessionUpdate`]s it implies — usually one, often none. It is a state
//! machine rather than a function because some provider facts need memory:
//!
//! - Cursor sends the same `tool_call` event for the opening announcement and
//!   every later progress report; ACP distinguishes `tool_call` from
//!   `tool_call_update`, so the machine remembers which call ids it has
//!   announced.
//! - Cursor's typed tool descriptor (`interaction_update.toolCall.type`)
//!   always arrives *after* the bare-named `tool_call` event it describes, so
//!   the machine records it per call id to refine later updates — the opening
//!   announcement can only ever rely on the tool's name.
//!
//! - Result events retain repository branches and pull request identity for
//!   the host's durable session metadata, independently of ACP updates.
//!
//! Everything else is stateless mapping. Notably, `interaction_update`'s
//! `text-delta`/`thinking-delta` subtypes duplicate the `assistant` and
//! `thinking` events one-for-one on real streams — consuming both would
//! double every chunk — so the envelope is ignored except for the subtypes
//! that carry something unique.
//!
//! Cursor reports incremental output tokens (`token-delta`) but never a
//! context-window size, while ACP's `usage_update` reports context used out
//! of a sized window. Inventing a size would misrender in any client that
//! shows a percentage, so usage is deliberately not translated.
