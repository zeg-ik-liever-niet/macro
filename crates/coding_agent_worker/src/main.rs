//! The agent harness daemon: serve a registered harness's agent sessions from
//! this machine.
//!
//! `macrod` is one process and one command: the serving core (SSE listener,
//! harness bridge) running inside a terminal control panel that shows what
//! it is serving - the registration, the agents bound to it, their sessions,
//! and the daemon's own logs - and manages its own pairing, config, and
//! retirement.
//!
//! A first run starts unpaired: the panel offers pairing (press `p`), the
//! user approves the printed code in the web app, and the minted harness
//! credential is embedded in the sensitive `macrod.toml`. Once paired, the
//! daemon connects to the runtime gateway and bridges the configured ACP
//! harness, making model discovery available before any agents exist. Each
//! `agent_trigger.new` delivery opens a session and forwards the first prompt;
//! `agent_trigger.existing` deliveries forward follow-up messages.
