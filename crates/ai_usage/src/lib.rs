//! AI cost logging — a robust log of AI usage with a flexible admin query API.
//!
//! The crate follows the hexagonal layout used elsewhere in this workspace:
//! - [`domain`] holds the cost model, ports, and the service that computes
//!   cost from a model id and token counts or audio duration.
//! - [`outbound`] holds the Postgres storage adapter.
//! - [`inbound`] holds the axum router mounted in the document cognition
//!   service (DCS).
//!
//! The agent crate records usage through the [`UsageRecorder`](domain::UsageRecorder)
//! port; recording is best-effort and never fails the originating call.

pub mod inbound;
pub mod outbound;
