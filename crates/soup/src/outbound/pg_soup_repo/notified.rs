//! The notified-at candidate query: one keyset-paginated page of entities the
//! user holds a live notification for, newest notification first.
//!
//! Every candidate is gated on existence, deletion and access, and on the
//! request's filters where soup owns the fold (documents, chats, projects,
//! calendar events, properties). Channel, channel-thread, email,
//! foreign-entity and reminder candidates are gated on access (plus the
//! notification-state and, for emails, importance conjuncts their trees
//! imply): their filter trees fold in their own domains' query
//! builders, so the service applies them in full when it hydrates the page
//! through those legs and drops the candidates that fail, refilling from the
//! next candidate page. A short page from this query therefore still means
//! the feed is exhausted, but a short hydrated page does not.
//!
//! A channel notification that names a message as its secondary event item
//! (mentions and thread replies) is keyed as a `channel_message` candidate on
//! that message — the thread root — because that is the row the client
//! attributes the notification to; the channel row keeps only channel-level
//! notifications.
