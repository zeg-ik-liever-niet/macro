//! The per-session queue of turn-occupying actions.
//!
//! Prompts (and compaction) occupy a whole agent turn, and ACP runs one turn
//! at a time - so while a turn runs, further turn-occupying actions wait here
//! rather than interleaving on the wire. Entries hold the *raw* user text:
//! composition happens at dispatch, which is what makes a queued prompt
//! editable and gives it fresh channel context when it actually runs. The
//! chip is usually announced then too, except a channel follow-up that
//! steers a running turn: it goes to the front and posts its chip when it is
//! accepted, so the reply sits on the follow-up rather than after the
//! cancelled turn or behind work queued earlier.
//!
//! In-memory on purpose. The queue lives beside the session's live actor on
//! the replica that manages it, and dies with the process - a restart loses
//! whatever was waiting, exactly like it always lost an in-flight turn.
//!
//! Callers mutate this only from the session's command worker, which is what
//! serializes an edit against the dispatch that might be claiming the same
//! entry. The structure itself only promises per-call consistency.
