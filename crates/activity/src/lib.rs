#![deny(missing_docs)]
//! The activity protocol and its storage/consumer machinery.
//!
//! One activity: a principal did something to an entity at a time. Every
//! activity surface (feeds, entity timelines, soup attribution sorts) is a
//! query over the single `activity_events` table; there are no derived
//! tables.
//!
//! Ownership boundary: this crate owns **what an activity is** — the
//! durable [`Action`](domain::models::Action) vocabulary, the
//! [`Activity`](domain::models::Activity) row shape, and the
//! [`DomainActivity`](domain::models::DomainActivity) contract. Domain
//! crates own **what counts as activity in their domain**: they depend on
//! this crate with `default-features = false` (models only) and implement
//! their own event → activity mappings. The hosting service is the
//! composition root: it declares the consumed topics and dispatches each
//! decoded event to the owning domain's mapping.
//!
//! Features: `outbound` (Postgres adapter), `consumer` (generic Kafka
//! consumer and realtime Kafka adapters), `realtime` (user-scoped realtime
//! distribution); all on by default. The models and wire events are always
//! available.
