//! The activity model — the protocol domains implement and the storage
//! shape the consumer persists.
//!
//! Ownership boundary: **this crate owns what an activity is; domains own
//! what counts as activity in their domain.** Domains construct activities
//! through two doors:
//!
//! - [`Activity::common`] for [`CommonAction`]s, which are valid on every
//!   entity kind by definition — no pairing proof needed.
//! - [`Activity::from_domain`] for entity-exclusive actions, reachable only
//!   through a domain-owned type implementing [`DomainActivity`]. The domain
//!   crate is the authority on its own action vocabulary and its projection
//!   into the durable [`Action`].
//!
//! [`Activity`] itself cannot be literal-constructed (private field), so an
//! invalid pairing like a document with a `Messaged` action has no
//! expressible path into storage.
