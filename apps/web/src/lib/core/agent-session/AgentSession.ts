/**
 * One live agent session: the fold machine, the realtime rows that feed it,
 * and the REST calls that act on it, behind one object with one event stream.
 *
 * Framework-free. A surface acquires the session for the ids it shows and
 * releases it on unmount; every surface showing the same session shares one
 * instance, so the log is fetched once, folded once, and speculated once.
 *
 * Speculation lives in the machine, not here. `issue` folds an action the
 * moment it is sent and the machine promotes it when the log confirms it,
 * rebases it when a foreign row lands first, and drops it if this class
 * retracts it. Listeners only ever see fold events; whether a message is
 * still on the wire is a field on the message, never a second channel.
