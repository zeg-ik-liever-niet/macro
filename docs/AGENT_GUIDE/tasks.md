# Tasks

## Surface

`Go to Tasks` → `/app/component/tasks`. Tabs: `My tasks`, `Created by me`, and `Team tasks`.
The desktop toolbar contains search (`Ctrl+F`), `Sort`, `Group`, and `Filter`;
the filter uses the legacy compact option rows and searchable Assignee, Created by,
and Tags submenus. Multi-select choices keep the menu open; Escape dismisses it.
Task creation is available from the `New` button in the Tasks sidebar. Below the tabs the
sidebar has a collapsible `Tags` section listing every personal and team tag, with a
`New tag` button beside the heading. Clicking a tag narrows the current tab to tasks
carrying it (the same selection as the `Tags` group of the `Filter` menu); clicking it again
clears it, and switching tabs clears it like any other filter. On mobile, the tabs
are pills and the leading sliders button opens one drawer containing Sort, Group, and
Filters (including Tags). The mobile bottom dock has the Ask AI input, a separate **+ Task**
button, and Search.

New accounts are seeded with three sample tasks (`Intro to tasks`, `Advanced task features`,
`How we use tasks at Macro`).

Click a task row or favorite to replace the list with the editable task document. Its top
bar shows the originating task tab as a text-only return breadcrumb,
followed by the task name and actions, Share, and the Details/Properties side-panel
toggle. The return label matches the task title's font weight in both wide and narrow
layouts. Narrow splits also show a close button when multiple splits are open. Choose
the originating tab breadcrumb, a task tab, or a tag to return to the list.
Shift-click a row or favorite to open it in a new split
instead. Keyboard list navigation only moves focus; press Enter to open the focused task.

## Create a task

On touch devices, task creation opens in a bottom sheet with a drag handle and
scrollable, keyboard-aware content. Its glass pane has broad screen-scaled
corners, an 8px outer inset, and a blurred backdrop, matching the create and
filter sheets. Desktop uses the centered composer dialog.

1. Click the `Task` button (or `Create` → `Task T`, or keyboard `c` then `t`).
2. A dialog opens with the title contenteditable focused (placeholder `New task`), plus
   `Add description...`, and property buttons: `Not Started` (status), `Priority`, assignee
   chip (defaults to you), `Due Date`, `Change or select tags`, `Attach image or video`,
   a `Create More` switch, and `Create Task Ctrl ↵`.
3. `type_text` the title, then press **Ctrl+Enter** to create (the `Create Task` button
   enables once there is a title). Dialog also offers `Continue editing in split` to open the
   task as a full document.

Tasks are documents under the hood (creation hits `POST /dss/documents/create_task`), so they
also show up in Files/`All` and in AI-chat document listings.

## Bulk delete

Select task rows with their leading checkboxes, choose **Actions → Delete items**,
then confirm **Delete**. With GraphQL Soup enabled, selected rows disappear while
requests are pending, including rows loaded through grouped pagination. The
confirmation closes when the whole batch succeeds. After a partial failure it
reports how many items were deleted and keeps only failed items in the dialog for
retry; successful items must not be submitted again. Confirmed deletions are
removed from split histories immediately, even if the dialog is then canceled.
Cancel clears stale selection and focuses a surviving failed item or a live
neighbor; it does not undo successful deletions or run deferred email deletions.
After a partial deletion is retried successfully, focus uses a surviving neighbor
captured before deletion (next, then previous), rather than restarting at the top
of the list. If both neighbors disappeared, it falls back near the original list
position, skipping group headers and load-more rows.
Failed items return to Soup and search immediately, while successful removals
remain absent from both.
Successfully deleted items stay hidden until all enabled GraphQL Soup lists
revalidate successfully, even if the first refresh fails. Refresh is attempted
at most three times (one- and two-second retry delays); suppression expires one
minute after deletion finishes if revalidation remains unavailable. The
GraphQL-disabled path retains its existing behavior.

For verification, use disposable tasks and delay only their DELETE requests:
rows should disappear before those requests complete. Then fail a Soup refresh:
successful deletes should remain hidden after the confirmation closes and clear
their suppression after a successful retry. Partial deletion failures restore
only the failed items.

## Other list actions

With GraphQL Soup enabled, **Rename** updates the row title before the request
finishes, as well as updating previews. **Move to folder**, **Remove from folder**,
and **Duplicate** refresh mounted GraphQL lists after the server responds; a
manual page reload is not required. Duplication does not show a placeholder before
the server returns the new item ID. Use disposable tasks/folders for these checks.

## View and edit task properties

An open task shows Status, Priority, and Assignees as property pills below its title. Task
mentions and document references also show the same three pills in their hover-card preview,
including properties that do not have a value yet. Click a preview pill to edit it without
opening the task; the property picker keeps the preview open while you make a selection.
Users with view or comment access see the same pills read-only.

Selecting Status or Priority dismisses the picker immediately, without waiting
for the save request. With the GraphQL cache active, the pill updates
optimistically while the request is pending. To verify, delay `SetEntityProperty`
on a disposable task: the picker should close before the response, and reopening
it during that delay should not let the earlier save close the new picker.
A failed save uses the mutation's rollback/error handling; it must not reopen
the picker or trigger a success refresh.

For multi-tab status checks, open the same task in several browser tabs
and change status repeatedly in the visible tab. Hidden tabs defer cache-change
refreshes for Quick Access searches, its channel list, and history, plus
cache-triggered GraphQL query rereads. Switching back catches up each affected
reader once against the latest cache state; closed readers must not restart.
Existing rows remain available while hidden. Initial loads, explicit requests,
saves, realtime cache writes, worker recovery, and the shared cache worker still
run. A query already fetching from the server must finish normally rather than
be canceled/reissued on return. Verify task status, mention search, and history
catch up after switching tabs, including when the cache-owning tab is hidden.

## Messages as tasks

In any channel composer, toggle the `Task` switch before sending to create a task from the
message.

### Nested sidebar tags

Tag names containing `/` render with one child level (for example, `Work/Urgent`).
Deeper paths remain in the child label: `Work/Customers/Acme` appears as
`Customers/Acme` under `Work`, alongside any actual `Customers` tag.
Use the caret to expand or collapse a branch. A folder-only parent expands without
filtering; clicking an actual tag selects only that tag, including when it has
children. Personal and team paths stay separate. Ancestors of restored selected
tags start expanded. Filter-menu options continue to show full tag names.
